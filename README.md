# [aryadee.dev](www.aryadee.dev) is my website / blog

code blocks highlighted with highlight.js

math is rendered with katex for latex, and made more ergonomic in svelte with mathlifier.

`add_blog_post.py` converts a python interactive notebook or markdown file into a svelte post

Feel free to fork this, BUT it contains a part of my photo editing web app in `src/routes/(blank)/filmic`.  Do not rehost or distribute that.

SvelteKit is cool.
