<p>
	My name is Arya. I am a computer engineer and I like to code.
	<br /><br />
	I completed my master's at UC Irvine with my thesis on modeling multi-core SoCs. I was advised
	by professor Rainer DÃ¶mer, doing research under the UCI CECS Lab.
	<br /><br />
	I have an affinity for signal processing: audio, image, data analysis--basically anything that
	needs an <code>ndArray</code>.
	<br /><br />
	My hobbies match my affinity; in my spare time, I make music, digital art, and take photos.
	<br /><br />
	I am currently looking for new work. If you'd like to get in touch, please email me at adaroui@uci.edu.
	<br /><br />
	Cheers.
